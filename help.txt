Decal Converter Help - Options, usage, and info:
    
• Single Decal - Normal

  This will take a file that the background was removed with remove.bg ( with or without "-removebg-preview" in the filename ), and create a backup copy, make all visible color black, colorize, Create a .gif from the colorized images, Create tablet images for Raven's Decals, and Put black image on white background. 

• Single Decal - ( Mirrored )
  
  This will do everything that "Single Decal - Normal" does, but it will mirror the decal.
 
• Multiple Decals

  This will also do everything that "Single Decal - Normal" does, but you can select a directory with multiple transparent background decals.
 
• Clean Decal Directories
  This option will remove files (Not the main directories) from the following directory:
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/Original
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/Black-Fill
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/White-Background
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/Colorized
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/GIF
  ◦ /home/[ your_name ]/Decals/Tablet
 
• A temp directory will be created in your "Decals" directory named ".tmp" to perform the conversions.
  This directory will be deleted when you exit Decal Converter.

• remove.bg can be found here - https://www.remove.bg
